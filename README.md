This project is a Java Application that serves as an interface to a local MySQL database storing contact information for an organisations staff members. I developed this Java code using an OSX operating system therefore a local MySQL server was needed. For this, I used MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/). I have also implemented some extraction functionality that will export data to csv (comma separated values) along with creating some visual graphs.

I found this project useful as a learning tool to understand the following:
* GUI Components
* Event Handling
* Implementing Listener Interfaces
* Anonymous Inners Classes for event handling
* Accessing Databases with JDBC
* Basic SQL commands – including Create, Select, Insert, Update
* Introduction to JSP – Java Server Pages
* Creating a search and search results page
* Inserting records into a DB using a web front end

If you are looking to start this project there are some credentials you will need to have so the Java application can hook up into your database. You will need the following:

* Connection URL (Oracle or MySQL)
* Username
* Password

There is a mySQL file containing a list of commands used to insert records to the database. These can be used to make sure your retrieval statements are working from your client side (Java application) before hooking up insertions.

You will also see a JAR folder containing the necessary JARs for connection to the database.

If any user has major issue with setting up this project please feel free to email me at engineertsmith@gmail.com.

I ([Thomas Smith](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/profiles/005500000060t7VAAQ)) will be maintaining this project and am more than happy to listen to any suggestions or further implementation ideas.
